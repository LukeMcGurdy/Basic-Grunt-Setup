# Basic Grunt Setup

The Gruntfile.js and package.json files required for a super basic Grunt setup. This setup will runs Sass, autoprefixer, cssnano and watch. So your Sass will be compiled and the output will have appropriate vendor prefixed added/ removed (autoprefixer) and be minified and generally tidied up (cssnano).

I'll build ontop of this over time but I'll keep these basic config files available.
