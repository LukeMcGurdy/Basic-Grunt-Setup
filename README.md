# Basic Grunt Setup

The package.json and Gruntfile.js required for a super basic Grunt setup. This will runs Sass, autoprefixer, cssnano and watch. So your Sass will be compiled and the output will have appropriate vendor prefixed added/ removed (autoprefixer) and be minified and generally tidied up (cssnano).

I'll build ontop of this over time but I'll keep this basic config available.
